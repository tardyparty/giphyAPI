<!-- Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.

1 Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.

2 Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.

3 List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.

4 Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio

5 Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.

6 This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.

7 If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies) -->
